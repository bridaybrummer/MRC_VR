## Purpose

This project analyses South African vital registration data to:

1. **Assess data quality** by examining the proportion of garbage codes (uninformative cause-of-death codes) across provinces and healthcare facilities
2. **Monitor and evaluate** vital registration data quality against demographic models (Thembisa, NCODV)
3. **Evaluate service accessibility** by measuring population coverage of Department of Home Affairs offices
4. **Develop statistical methods** for improving cause-of-death classification

## Methodology

All analyses are conducted in R, with interactive visualizations built using Plotly. Key methods include:

- **Spatial analysis** using the `sf` package for distance calculations
- **Population modelling** with weighted distribution models
- **Time series analysis** of mortality trends
- **Data quality metrics** following WHO standards for garbage code classification
